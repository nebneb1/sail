c |-| Evening 
c |-| *burps*
c |-| Well that just happened
c |-| ...
c |-| Say...
c |-| What are you doing outside so early?
c |-| ...
c |-| Is it your grandfather?
c |-| I miss him too
c |-| ...
c |-| When he left to [b]the nearby island[/b], and never came back-
c |-| I...
c |-| I didn't know what to do with myself
c |-| But that was so... so long ago
c |-| We need to move on
c |-| Life happens
c |-| We just need to take care of the here and now.
c |-| Say, lets play a game of cards later
c |-| You're always so eager to get out and explore
c |-| Lets take today off

f |-| Hey there
f |-| What are you doing out here on the dock?
f |-| ...
f |-| Are you going to find him?
f |-| Your grandfather, I mean
f |-| I would recommend against that
f |-| I don't want to lose you too
f |-| ...
f |-| You look like you have already decided
f |-| Do you even know how to sail the boat he left you?
f |-| No?
f |-| *sigh*
f |-| Well, if you're set on going,
f |-| The least I could do is show you the ropes
f |-| The most important thing to know is where the wind is coming from
f |-| If you look wayy up to the top of your boat, you can see a red flag
f |-| That points in the direcion the wind is going
f |-| You can never sail directly upwind, but you can sail pretty close to it
f |-| The more upwind you sail without going too far, the faster you go
f |-| Got it?
f |-| The first thing I want to point out is the main sheet, it is the pully in the middle of the boat.
f |-| You can pull it in or let it out in order to adjust the big sail
f |-| The more upwind you are, the more you have to pull it in to get a good speed
f |-| Ok?
f |-| The other sail towards the front of your boat is called the jib
f |-| You need to adjust it so that the jib is on the same side as your main sail
f |-| In order to change which side the jib is on, you must first losen it from its current side
f |-| After that, you can pull the jib in from the other side
f |-| You want to tighten it as much as you can! The tighter, the better your speed
f |-| But you may want to let it out just a little bit, so that it can have a good shape
f |-| That make sense?
f |-| So at the back of the boat is the tiller,
f |-| You can use that to steer
f |-| If you push it left, the boat turns right, and vice versa
f |-| Don't worry about it though, im sure you will get the hang of it quickly.
f |-| At the front of the boat, you have your anchor
f |-| If you want to take a break, you can just put it down and relax 
f |-| that'll save where you are, too
f |-| To interract with anything, just hold [SPACE] near it and use the key shown
f |-| Got it?
f |-| The last thing is your compass, it's right next to your tiller
f |-| It will show you where to head next.
f |-| If you hold [W] while on your anchor, you can push off land
f |-| I think thats just about everything
f |-| Well phew... 
f |-| I hope you got all that
f |-| To get going, you can just pull up the anchor and start sailing
f |-| I already have your comapss programmed for the nearby island
f |-| Theres a nice old lady there, maybe she knows something about your grandfather
f |-| Good luck on you journey
f |-| If you need me to repeat it again, just talk to me.

w |-| I once had a husband
w |-| He had no name
w |-| He never told me it
w |-| I didn’t ask why
w |-| Turns out that was a mistake
w |-| I also never told him my birthday
w |-| That too, was a mistake
w |-| We were too comfortable not understanding each other
w |-| Too complacent that we could stay like that
w |-| Stay...
w |-| He left
w |-| Oh, your grandpa left too?
w |-| He most likely went the same way as my dear husband
w |-| There is an old island
w |-| Reclusive, in sort
w |-| Far, far away
w |-| It is where people must go
w |-| I will be there one day too
w |-| Follow your compass
w |-| Trust it with your precious time
w |-| You will make it
w |-| I assure you

m |-| You ask, why do I come to Alaska?
m |-| I come...
m |-| No particular reason
m |-| I come because I must
m |-| I must move
m |-| Without moving you are dead
m |-| Tomorrow, when the sun dips below the horizon
m |-| I move once again
m |-| Over to the island where they all go
m |-| A lonely, disturbed island
m |-| Well... let me rephrase
m |-| It is only lonely to those watching from afar
m |-| For those on it...
m |-| It is the finest peace one could ask for
m |-| I heard a rumor
m |-| A very distant rumor
m |-| That the island actually lives on the back of a whale
m |-| Yes, a whale!
m |-| It is a moving island
m |-| Hard to find, but rewarding at last, because you never have to sail again
m |-| You land on its shore, and it sails for you

g |-| Morning son
g |-| It’s good to see you sailed out here
g |-| I’m sure Faraday’s message got to you well
g |-| And he told you about me leaving
g |-| I just couldn’t bare to sit anymore
g |-| I had to stand up
g |-| I had to leave
g |-| I often think that this world is so simple
g |-| That my stagnant body is meant to be still
g |-| Taking in all aspects of nature
g |-| But truly, that is wrong
g |-| Stillness is a lie
g |-| To experience, is to move
g |-| To move integrates you with nature
g |-| You become part of its abstract world
g |-| And with that, you see more clearly what it truly is
g |-| I needed that
g |-| I needed to be part of the ocean that is always moving
g |-| I needed to see the foam crash and the shore sink, inflating with each tide
g |-| I hope you can forgive me
g |-| Or more so, I hope you can agree with me
g |-| Nevertheless, thank you for coming
g |-| Perhaps I will get up now and continue my venture
g |-| All this lying has made me stiff
g |-| My joints ache and they cry to be twisted
g |-| Your boat, or mine?
g |-| To what island?
